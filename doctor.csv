After doing some research, I decided to schedule an appointment with Dr. Ala Klimuk. She is by far the WORST doctor that I have ever met. She only cares about how much money she can make, but doesn't care about her patients. I had blood tests done with her and some of them came back abnormal. First, they do not have any online patient portal. Second, she didn't bother to call to discuss the results with me. I was the one who had to call several times to find out if they received the results. Also, while I was under her care, I ended up in emergency room with some sharp pain. Few days later, I scheduled an appointment with her because the pain didn't go away completely and I was concerned, even though ER could not find anything wrong. Without investigating any further, Dr. Klimuk sent me back to the ER. She NEVER followed up with me to see what the issue was. I ended up paying so much for my unnecessary second trip to the emergency room. I would not recommend her to anyone."
